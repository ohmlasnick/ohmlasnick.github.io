In the [brainLENS (*L*earning, *E*ngineering, & *N*eural *S*ystems) Laboratory](https://www.brainlens.org/), run by lab director Fumiko Hoeft (MD PhD), Oliver works on several projects. The lab uses multimodal brain imaging techniques and computational approaches to examine the underlying neural and cognitive processes of reading and language. Oliver's projects focus primarily on the anatomical (MRI) and functional (EEG, fMRI) correlates of developmental dyslexia. Feel free to check out his [portfolio](https://ohmlasnick.github.io/portfolio/) for more info on ongoing projects.
