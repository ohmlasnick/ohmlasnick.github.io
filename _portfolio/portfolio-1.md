*For this project, I investigated low-gamma band (30-45 Hz) power in the temporal lobes during rest and associated lateralization effects in a large sample of participants with or without phonemic decoding deficits (dyslexia) and comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This work was based on the temporal sampling framework (TSF, see work by Usha Goswami). The TSF states that neural tracking of auditory speech at different timescales (entrainment) contributes to the establishment of phonological skills early in life, before we learn to read, and that this process occurs atypically in children who develop dyslexia. However, the question of whether low-gamma activity, indexing the timescale of phonemic tracking, is reduced or shows atypical intrinsic hemispheric dominance in dyslexia had not been sufficiently explored.*

Oliver successfully defened his thesis in Fall 2021. The full manuscript is currently being revised for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
