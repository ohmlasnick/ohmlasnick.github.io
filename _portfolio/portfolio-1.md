*The development of effective reading skills lies at the heart of our modern educational systems. At the same time, specific reading disorder (RD, or developmental dyslexia) is one of the most common learning disorders (affecting 5-10% of the population). Children with RD tend to have better outcomes if they are identified early and given appropriate intervention. One of the most promising leads in the creation of a universal screening system for dyslexia is that it is heritable and tends to run in families. However, family history exists on a continuum, and different methods for identifying it may index differing aspects of genetic and environmental contributions. In this project, we aimed to determine how different forms of family history are related to cognitive profiles and cortical morphometry. To what extent can genetic similarity between relatives with RD and at-risk children (the ‘RD kinship index’) predict these outcomes?*
