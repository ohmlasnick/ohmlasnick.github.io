During the Spring 2022 semester, Oliver & other graduate students at UConn served as instructors for the [*Ask A Brain Scientist*](https://birc.uconn.edu/events/ask-a-brain-scientist/) series. The series is an excellent opportunity for kids aged 8-13 to learn about their brains from the very people doing cutting-edge research. As an instructor, Oliver gave a guest lecture on the neurobiology of learning and memory. During others' lectures, Oliver also served as a facilitator when the children had questions. At the end of the course, he helped to evaluate their final projects. The overall course was pioneered and run by Fumiko Hoeft.
